# CBRd
 Public repository for CheirBot, a bot used for Smogon Little Cup, Photeus and other misc places. It is integrated with Discord, Pokemon Showdown and serves its own webpage. 
 
 It is architected with self-contained and atomic modules, which helps keep the codebase tidy and prevents anything from touching anything it shouldn't. As a rule-of-thumb, modules should only do one thing and shouldn't be longer than 50 lines: if it's longer, you probably want to split it up more!
